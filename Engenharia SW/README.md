### 1) Comentários so livro Software Engineering at Google
"The great thing about tech is that there is never only one way to do something. Instead, there is a series of trade-offs we all must make depending on the circumstances of our team and situation. What can we cheaply take from open source? What can our team build? What makes sense to support for our scale?"

"An early attempt to define software engineering produced a good definition for this viewpoint: 'The multiperson development of multiversion programs.' This suggests the difference between software engineering and programming is one of both time and people. Team collaboration presents new problems, but also provides more potential to produce valuable systems than any single programmer could."
